# BOII Development - Developer Utility Library

## üåç Overview

Welcome to `boii_utils`, a comprehensive utility resource tailored for resource developers and server administrators.
This suite of tools is designed to simplify, streamline, and enhance the development process, offering a wide range of functionalities that span from string manipulations to table operations, and from input validations to miscellaneous utilities.

The utility library is constantly growing, anything that can save development time for boii resources gets added.
If its saving us time, it should save you time also.

The main aim here is just to create a large consolidated resource to handle the majority of repeat code and cut down on repetitive for everyone.

Happy Scripting!

## üíπ Dependencies

None utils is standalone. 
For framework bridge functions you of course need your chosen framework installed.

## üìù Notes

- Utils is constantly being developed, some things may change that may affect functionality of resources you choose to build with this. However we will try to minimise this as much as possible.
- New functions are being added all the time, as updated progress for boii development resources if theres something that can save future time by adding into utils, it will be added.
