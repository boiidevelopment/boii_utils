![utils_thumb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba90edbe-a318-4282-bfe2-3987607d4aa4)

## Overview

Welcome to boii_utils — your new favorite excuse to never write boilerplate code again.

This all-in-one, modular, feature-stuffed utility library is built specifically for FiveM script developers who are tired of reinventing the wheel every time they touch a new resource.

In v2.0, everything’s been rewritten from the ground up:

- The bloat? Gone.
- The bugs? Squashed.
- The logic? Rewired with duct tape and ambition.
- The license? MIT, because freedom tastes better without GPL breath.

What you’re getting now is a cleaner, faster, actually organized toolkit designed to make your life easier and your codebase prettier.
Use just what you need, ignore the rest, and regain a little sanity.

## Why use boii_utils?

Because you've rebuilt the same helper functions so many times, they deserve their own therapy arc.
Because every script starts with "utils.lua" and ends with tears.
Because this library exists to do the boring stuff, so you can focus on the fun, broken, overambitious features your server totally needs.

- **Simplifies Scripting:** Functions that just work, without needing a 12-tab Stack Overflow deep dive.
- **Prebuilt Systems:** Fully modular. Plug in, power up, and pretend you built it from scratch.
- **Reduces Dev Load:** Spend less time writing boilerplate and more time watching your players ignore your server rules.

## Highlights

### **Framework & UI Bridges:** Making peace treaties between frameworks since inception.
- **Framework Bridge:** `boii`, `esx`, `nd`, `ox`, `qb`, `qbx` because commitment issues are real.
- **Notification Bridge:** `default`, `boii`, `esx`, `okok`, `ox`, `qb` every flavor of annoying popup you could desire.
- **DrawText Bridge:** `default`, `boii`, `esx`, `okok`, `ox`, `qb` for when you really need to make your players read something.

### **Standalone Systems:** Because frameworks shouldn’t hold all the power.
- **Callbacks:** For when you're tired of yelling into the void; now it yells back, politely.
- **Commands:** Database-backed permissions included, or switch to Ace if you insist on complicating things.
- **Licences:** Comprehensive license system including theory tests, practical tests, points management, and revoking, like your local DMV, minus the soul-crushing lines.
- **XP:** Level-up system with growth factors and max levels, because who doesn't love arbitrary numbers going up?

### **Unique Scripting Modules:** Pre-made shortcuts for the lazy genius in all of us.
- **Characters Module:** Enough functions to build character creators, clothing stores, tattoos, everything you need to keep your players staring at themselves for hours.
- **Vehicles Module:** If it drives and you can customize it, these functions probably have you covered.

### **UI Elements:** The obligatory flashy bits to trick players into thinking you know what you're doing.
- **Action Menu:** Bored of spinning circles deciding what to click next? Try out a different take.
- **Context Menu:** Simple and effective, with header images.
- **Dialogue:** NPC conversations without the awkward silence.
- **DrawText:** Display on screen text clearly, ensuring players ignore it even faster.
- **Notify:** Notification styles for all occasions: `success`, `error`, `info`, `warning`, `primary`, `secondary`, `light`, `dark`, `critical`, `neutral`.
- **Progress Bar:** The classic, comforting sight of incremental loading bars.
- **Progress Circle:** Revolutionary innovation.. it's like a progress bar, but circular!
